# Miscellanea for CommonCore Framework for Unity

## Introduction

Various bits and pieces for [CommonCore](https://github.com/XCVG/commoncore/). A bit of a dumping ground which will hopefully get more organized as time goes on.

## Index

* **Compatibility** Helpers for backwards compatibility with older versions of CommonCore, ie for upgrading projects. Mostly code files that can be dropped in piecemeal as needed.
* **CaliforniumRpgCompatibility** Code files and resources that provide the old stats, skills, and RPG calculations intended for Ascension III after those were removed in CommonCore 4.
* **VNX** Visual novel extension components originally created for [See Who I Am](https://xcvg.itch.io/see-who-i-am). Probably won't work out of the box without a bit of work.

It is **strongly** recommended that you license derivatives under the MIT License or dual-license them rather than using the Creative Commons license exclusively. The MIT License is a GPL-compatible permissive software license approved by the Free Software Foundation and the Open Source Initiative, while the Creative Commons license is designed for creative works and has several ambiguities when used to license software. The Creative Commons option is provided primarily for compliance with game jams that require entries to be released under such a license.

Some freely-licensed third-party assets may be included in the repository. These will be specified where they exist and the licenses will be included. In general, all may be reused and distributed under the same conditions as the code even if the specific license differs.
